This project presents a comprehensive agricultural technology system aimed at empowering farmers with data-driven insights and advanced tools to enhance farming practices.
The proposed system integrates five modules, namely 
1)Crop Prediction, 
2)Fertilizer Recommendation,
3)Plant Disease Detection, 
4)E-commerce Platform, and 
5)Chatbot, 
with the addition of an "Admin" role for efficient management. 
The system uses machine learning algorithms and open APIs to predict suitable crops based on NPK values, pH, and real- time weather data. 
Farmers receive personalized fertilizer recommendations for optimal crop growth. 
The Plant Disease Detection module employs Convolutional Neural Networks to identify diseases in plant leaves and suggest remedies and pesticides. 
The E- commerce Platform allows farmers to purchase recommended products, fostering seamless access to agricultural supplies. 
The NLP-powered Chatbot serves as a virtual agricultural expert, providing instant responses to user inquiries.
The Admin role oversees system functionalities, user management, and updates.
The proposed system amalgamates traditional farming wisdom with modern technologies, empowering farmers for sustainable and efficient agriculture.
